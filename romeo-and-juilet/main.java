FATE: Juilet could have chosen anyone to love but yet
she choose to love Romeo, which led to their tragic
death/downfall. In this program above it shows how
Romeo could have been easily taken out or put into
the picture within just a few seconds. It also brings
curiosity to the table when Tybalt dies, and Mercutio
puts a curse on both of the houses. As along with all
of the other bad decisions that Romeo and Juilet make
throughout the entire story.
